# The box-driven install path, on kind.
#
# hack/e2e-kind.sh installs the chart with `helm upgrade --install` and asserts
# the result. This script installs the same release the other way: `box
# bootstrap` decides the cluster, installs the platform layer (Envoy Gateway's
# Gateway API CRDs, MetalLB, the GatewayClass and Gateway, the admission
# policy), then runs init for root, which writes root's grant and values file
# and hands over to `box apply`.
#
# The chart is installed the way a user installs one: `helm package` from this
# working tree, `helm push` to a distribution registry container bound to 127.0.0.1, and
# box pulls it from there with --chart-repo (and --chart-version). box never
# reads `charts/` from its own tree; the kind cluster never pulls the chart.
#
# Three scenarios, three clusters:
#
#   fresh         a cluster with nothing installed. The Gateway box applies
#                 gets no address, so MetalLB and its pool are installed, and
#                 the address is then checked from the host. Then:
#                 a second bootstrap installs nothing (no Helm revision, no
#                 changed spec or label on anything box owns, byte-identical
#                 seedbox files), one edited value is printed as a diff and
#                 applied, and the claims outlive `helm uninstall`.
#   preinstalled  MetalLB installed the way a user would -- the upstream
#                 manifest and an IPAddressPool, not through box -- before
#                 `box bootstrap` ever runs. The probe answers, so box installs
#                 no MetalLB release and no s5n-pool, removes its probe
#                 Service, and the Gateway still becomes Programmed on an
#                 address from the pool that was already there.
#   foreign-gateway  a different Gateway API implementation -- NGINX Gateway
#                 Fabric -- installed before box runs, on Gateway API's
#                 standard channel. Envoy Gateway is the only implementation
#                 box supports (logins are checked at the edge by one provider
#                 through Envoy's SecurityPolicy), so box must refuse that
#                 cluster, naming the class and its controller, and write
#                 nothing: no namespace, no GatewayClass, no record.
#
# The login is part of every install: bootstrap puts one Authelia in
# s5n-system and one SecurityPolicy on the Gateway, root's `box init` creates
# the one account, and the fresh scenario then proves the whole flow with a
# cookie jar -- an app path redirects to the portal, the portal takes the
# password, the jar gets in, and the Arrs' own API keys still answer. The
# preinstalled scenario proves the same redirect on its own host name.
#
# The fresh scenario runs Pebble, Let's Encrypt's test ACME server, inside the
# cluster and points the production issuer at it, so HTTP-01 through the
# Gateway is proven on every run: Certificate Ready, HTTPS with Pebble's CA, an
# HTTP redirect for app paths, and a challenge path that is not redirected --
# including on a renewal issued with the redirect already in place. The
# preinstalled scenario's name does not resolve, which proves the self-signed
# half.
#
# Why one script and three clusters instead of a flag inside hack/e2e-kind.sh:
# the existing e2e is the chart's acceptance test, and its helm install is what
# proves the chart still installs the way users install it today. These
# scenarios are about box's decision, share the bootstrap command line, and
# disagree about what is on the cluster before it runs -- so they cannot share
# a cluster. `all` runs this script once per scenario, which gives each its own
# work directory, cluster name and exit code.
#
# Usage: hack/e2e-box.sh [--keep] [fresh|preinstalled|foreign-gateway|all]   (default: all)
