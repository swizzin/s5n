# The box-driven install path, on kind.
#
# hack/e2e-kind.sh installs the chart with `helm upgrade --install` and asserts
# the result. This script installs the same release the other way: `box
# bootstrap` decides the cluster, installs the platform layer (Envoy Gateway's
# Gateway API CRDs, MetalLB, the GatewayClass and Gateway, the admission
# policy), then runs init for root, which writes root's grant and values file
# and hands over to `box apply`.
#
# Three scenarios, three clusters:
#
#   fresh         a cluster with nothing installed. The Gateway box applies
#                 gets no address, so MetalLB and its pool are installed, and
#                 the address is then checked from the host. Then:
#                 a second bootstrap installs nothing (no Helm revision, no
#                 changed spec or label on anything box owns, byte-identical
#                 seedbox files), one edited value is printed as a diff and
#                 applied, and the claims outlive `helm uninstall`.
#   preinstalled  MetalLB installed the way a user would -- the upstream
#                 manifest and an IPAddressPool, not through box -- before
#                 `box bootstrap` ever runs. The probe answers, so box installs
#                 no MetalLB release and no s5n-pool, removes its probe
#                 Service, and the Gateway still becomes Programmed on an
#                 address from the pool that was already there.
#   existing      a different Gateway API implementation -- NGINX Gateway
#                 Fabric -- installed before box runs, on Gateway API's
#                 standard channel. box must use its Accepted class, never
#                 install Envoy Gateway beside it, put its own Gateway on that
#                 class, derive the NetworkPolicy peer from where that
#                 implementation's proxy actually runs, and still serve an app
#                 through the Gateway with the chart's URLRewrite.
#
# Why one script and three clusters instead of a flag inside hack/e2e-kind.sh:
# the existing e2e is the chart's acceptance test, and its helm install is what
# proves the chart still installs the way users install it today. These
# scenarios are about box's decision, share the bootstrap command line, and
# disagree about what is on the cluster before it runs -- so they cannot share
# a cluster. `all` runs this script once per scenario, which gives each its own
# work directory, cluster name and exit code.

# Usage: hack/e2e-box.sh [--keep] [fresh|preinstalled|existing|all]   (default: all)
